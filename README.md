# perceptron-pos-tagger

This is a university lab work for my Machine Learning 1 course.

The goal was to train and evaluate a Part-of-Speech tagger. For this, we implemented the perceptron algorithm from scratch. There are two versions: a vanilla (classic) perceptron and an averaged one.
In the averaged version, instead of using the weight vector obtained at the end of the training phase, we use an average of all the weight vectors encountered during training. The second version performs better on the test sets. 

We used annotated corpora from the [Universal Dependencies Project](https://universaldependencies.org/), I have not added them to this github repository.

Partial instructions for this lab can be found [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/perceptron-pos-tagger/blob/main/partial_instructions.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/perceptron-pos-tagger/blob/main/instructions_appendix.pdf) and my final report [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/perceptron-pos-tagger/blob/main/report.pdf).

I submitted this work in November 2021.
